I want to make absolutely clear that this project was created by kkkgo.  I have simply made some very minor changes for compatability with the Windows Server 2016 used by Paperspace's Core machines

# Add Store to Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB  
For Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 / 2016 LTSB or Windows Enterprise 2015 / 2016 LTSB N  
[Download](https://github.com/lixuy/LTSB-Add-MicrosoftStore/archive/2016.zip)  
## To install, run Add-Store.cmd as Administrator  
If you do not want App Installer / Purchase App / Xbox identity, delete each one appxbundle before running to install. However, if you plan on installing games or any app with in-purchase options, you should include everything.  
If the store still will not function, reboot. If still not working, open the command prompt as the administrator and run the following command, then reboot once more.  
```PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "& {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"```    
## Addition troubleshooting    
>Right click start  
Select Run  
Type in: WSReset.exe  
This will clear the cache if needed.  
## Windows Server 2016 Problem  
>This allowed me to update the other apps in the package (Xbox, etc..), but not allowed me to install new apps onto my computer that was already in my library.However, it did allow me to install apps using the "Business Store", which is no fun task. You have to shop on their website (not through the store app), then add the app via their website to your "private store", sign in the Windows Store App using your "Business Store Account", and finally those listed under your "private store", you could download and install.
  
# 为Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB增加应用商店  
适用于Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 / 2016 LTSB 或 Windows Enterprise 2015 / 2016 LTSB N

## 要开始安装, 请打包下载后用右键管理员运行 Add-Store.cmd   
如果您不想安装App Installer / Purchase App / Xbox，请在运行安装之前删除对应的.appxbundle后缀的文件。但是，如果您计划安装游戏，或带有购买选项的应用，则不要删除。   
如果装完之后商店仍然打不开，请先重启试试。如果仍然不行，请以管理员身份打开命令提示符并运行以下命令之后，然后再重启试试。  
```PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "& {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"```    
## 商店修复    
Win+R打开运行，输入WSReset.exe回车。    
该命令会清空并重置Windows Store商店的所有缓存。
